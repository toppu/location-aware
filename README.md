# location-aware
This is a simple app that uses the user's geographic location as an input and renders output to that user based on his location. MongoDB is used to store geographic position parameters (latitude, longitude, and etc).  I'm using (W3C Geolocation API)[http://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation-API/] for locating the visitors to our  app.
